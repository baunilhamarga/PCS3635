# PCS3635 – Digital Laboratory I

This repository contains the Verilog-based projects developed during the PCS3635 course at Poli USP, focused on learning and implementing digital circuits on FPGAs.

## 📁 Folder Structure

### `experiment_N` (Weeks 1–7)

These folders contain the weekly experiments developed throughout the course. Each week builds on the last, culminating in a full implementation of the classic **Genius game** (a memory sequence game) using **Verilog only**, targeting FPGA platforms.

The weekly progression covers key digital logic design concepts, including:
- Combinational logic
- Sequential circuits
- Finite state machines (FSMs)
- Clock dividers and counters
- Datapath and control unit design

---

### `semana_N` (PlaySeq Project)

These folders document the development of **PlaySeq**, a customized version of the Genius game created to assist **children on the autism spectrum** in developing **logical reasoning** through interactive gameplay.

#### 💡 Project Timeline:
- **Week 0** – Planning and research  
  - Understanding our client’s needs
  - Studying autism spectrum disorders (ASD)
  - Defining pedagogical adaptations
- **Weeks 1–4** – Implementation  
  - Verilog-based logic design
  - FPGA integration
  - Hardware interface construction
  - Visual identity and player manual creation

The **final version** of the PlaySeq game can be extracted from the [`playseq_final.qar`](./playseq_final.qar) file located at the root of the repository.
